        <h2>About Me</h2>
       <p> Hello and welcome to my personal portfolio. My name is Giuliano Vasconcelos, 
        and I possess a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Electrical Engineering. I have experience 
        working as a Procurement Analyst for the leading oil company in Brazil. I also 
        played a role at the largest mining company in Brazil during the critical period 
        of the Brumadinho Accident. Following this, I transitioned into the field of Data 
        Science and development, where I had the opportunity to work with Ford Company.</p>
